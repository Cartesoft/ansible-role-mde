===========

[![CI](https://github.com/deekayen/ansible-role-mdatp/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/deekayen/ansible-role-mdatp/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) [![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

[Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/linux-install-with-ansible).

If an error occurs during installation, the installer will only report a general failure. The detailed log will be saved to `/var/log/microsoft/mdatp_install.log`.


Dependencies
------------

curl

Default Variables
-----------------

Onboarding source supports replacing with a URL and expects the zip file downloaded from the Microsoft Defender Security Center device management onboarding website. This role expects you'll host that file internally on an artifact server like Nexus or as an unauthenticated LFS git object.

I know templating a jinja2 json file is also a potential route to upload configurations and would appreciate an elegant pull request to support something like that.
